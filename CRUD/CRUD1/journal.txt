Journal
This journal is to write down thoughts as I continue through the project. It will help internalize everything as well as provide insight into what I am doing.

Step 1:
We are building a CRUD app... CRUD means Create,Read,Update,Delete application. It's common in social media and blogs. It's fairly important to learn as a skill since pieces of it (such as how to save and how to delete) are largely important in other facets of web programming.

Project Setup: Create 3 files named index.html,style.css,main.js  and then put them on live server.

Step 2:
For HTML, put the basic template as laid out.

<body>
<h1>Social Media App</h1>
<div class="container">
    <div class="left"></div>
    <div class="right"></div>
</div>

</body>

To translate the code in our body: We have a heading called Social Media App. It sits structurally above a container div(classed as container).

Inside that container div are 2 more divs, .left and .right.

Step 3: The tutorial requires us to put our posts on the left side....so we have to put in .left a form.

<div class="left">
    <form id="form">
        <label for="post"> Write your post here</label>
        <br><br>
        <textarea name="post" id="input" cols="30" rows="10"></textarea>
        <br><br>
        <div id="msg"></div>
        <button type="submit">Post</button>
    </form>
</div>

This code makes a form called #form.  It has a label for some feature called "post" and tells users to write their post inside. It has 2 breaks for spacing and then it has a textarea element to hold the text. Since we are posting multi-lines potentially there is good reason to use textarea over input.  It's attributes give it id of #input", a name for backend of "post", and it assigns 30(width) x 10(height) via col/row system.

There is beneath a container div (#msg) that I suspect will house our message after JS, and it's type is submit because it'll do as it's text says (Post).
