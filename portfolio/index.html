            <article class="aboutme1">First things first: I am a web developer and designer based in Jerusalem,Israel. While most people specialize in either development or design, I am one of those unique people that sees value in mastering both fields.  Without a good design, good development will be difficult if not outright impossible. Without good development, a good design likewise cannot achieve it's fullest potential. </article>

                I am at the intersection between making things happen and asking the deeper philosophical questions such as:
                <ul>
                    <li>What makes a good website?</li>
                    <li>Why are some designs and layouts more aesthetic than others?</li>
                    <li>Is typography and font the difference between looking mundane and being truly awesome?</li>
                    <li>Are my pictures doing justice to the message I want to present to the world?</li>

            <p>This page was created for the curriculum of FreeCodeCamp as part of the 5 required projects to demonstrate successful passing of the Responsive Design course. It's intent is to demonstrate capability to create and organize basic pages with commonly used HTML and CSS functionality.  While some of the designs may be tacky, ugly, and all around unprofessional looking, the goal was to have completed works that could be improved upon. If you keep track, you will notice changes both dramatic and gradual in the future.
